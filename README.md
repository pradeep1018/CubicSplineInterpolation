# CubicSplineInterpolation
This repository contains the MATLAB code to perform Cubic Spline Interpolation on a set of given points. Enter the points in the form of (x, y). The code returns the interpolating function and displays a plot to demonstrate it. This was part of the course MA204: Introduction to Numerical Analysis offered by IIT Ropar.
